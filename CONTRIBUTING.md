We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). Format:

```

### Types

| Type | Description |

| `feat` | New feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `style` | Code style (formatting, semicolons, etc.) |
| `refactor` | Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
| `test` | Adding or fixing tests |
| `chore` | Maintenance (build, CI, dependencies) |

Omit scope for changes that affect the whole repo (root configs, CI, etc.).

chore: upgrade TypeScript to 5.9
```

## Pull Requests
